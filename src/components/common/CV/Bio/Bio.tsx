Over the past two years, I have immersed myself in JavaScript, completing both a web developer course at Kodilla and a backend developer course at MegaK. I have also gained hands-on experience as a freelancer, designing and implementing websites, which enhances my practical skills. Regular participation in meet.js meetings allows me to exchange knowledge and insights with fellow programmers, fostering a vibrant learning environment.'
